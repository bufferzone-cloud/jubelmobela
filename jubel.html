      <p><strong>Every Breath is a Second Chance: The Autobiography of Jubel Mobela</strong></p>

      <p>My name is <strong>Jubel Mobela</strong>, and this is my story—a journey shaped by struggle, lifted by hope, and driven by the belief that <strong>every breath is a second chance</strong>. From humble beginnings in Luanshya, Zambia, to the foundation of growing tech enterprises, my life has never followed a straight path. But in every setback, I've found <strong>renewal</strong>. In every hardship, a <strong>lesson</strong>. And in every moment of uncertainty, a <strong>second chance</strong> to rise again.</p>

        <i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Read More About My Journey
      </button>
    </div>

    <div class="bio-full" id="bioFull" style="display:none;">

      <p><strong>Chapter 1: A Childhood in Motion</strong></p>
      <p>I was born on <strong>July 21, 2002</strong>, in Luanshya, Zambia, during a time of personal and familial transition. When my parents separated at a young age, I began a life marked by movement—both physical and emotional. I first lived with my grandmother, who offered me her <strong>warmth</strong> and <strong>strength</strong>. Over the years, I moved between various relatives: from Kitwe to Lusaka, then back to Luanshya each place offering new challenges, new beginnings, and <strong>second chances</strong> to find stability.</p>
      
      <br>

      <p>Though life often felt unpredictable, I learned to embrace each new environment. <strong>Change became my constant companion</strong>, and <strong>adaptability became a necessity</strong>. My early school years saw similar shifts. I began in a private school in Kitwe, only to transfer to a public school in Nkana East. After my aunt's husband passed away, I moved back and forth between families. But through it all, I remained <strong>resilient</strong>.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Each move was a <strong>breath</strong> a new chance to learn, grow, and hold on to the hope that things would get better.</p>

      <br>

      <p><strong>Chapter 2: Education as Escape and Empowerment</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Education became my anchor</strong>. At Nkana Basic School in Kitwe, from Grade 5 to Grade 7, I poured my energy into academics and graduated with <strong>high marks</strong>. It was the first time I felt that my hard work could truly open doors for me. I continued my journey at Malela Secondary School, where I sat for my Grade 12 exams in 2018—and passed with <strong>excellence</strong>.</p>

      <br>

      <p>School was more than a place of learning. It was where I began to imagine a future beyond struggle. Every lesson, every exam, every long walk to class was a <strong>breath</strong> a <strong>second chance</strong> to rewrite my future.</p>

      <br>

      <p><strong>Chapter 3: Stepping Into the World</strong></p>
      <p>In 2019, I took my first steps into the professional world as a teacher at a private school. For two years, I taught students not just what was in their textbooks, but what I was learning myself—that you could come from little and still <strong>dream big</strong>. I learned how to <strong>communicate</strong>, <strong>lead</strong>, and <strong>inspire</strong>—skills that would shape the rest of my life.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Then in 2021, I interned at Power Tools Logistics as an <strong>auditor</strong>. It was my first true exposure to the corporate world. I was now wearing formal shoes, sitting in boardrooms, handling data, and solving real business problems. It felt like I had walked through a door I once thought was closed to me.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Every experience was a new <strong>breath</strong>. A <strong>second chance</strong> to discover who I could be.</p>

      <br>

      <p><strong>Chapter 4: The Tech Path and a Turning Point</strong></p>
      <p>My love for <strong>technology</strong> had always been simmering beneath the surface. In 2022, I followed that passion to <strong>Northern Technical College (NORTEC)</strong> in Ndola, enrolling in a Diploma in Computer Systems Engineering. I poured everything into my studies, earning recognition as the <strong>best student</strong> year after year. For the first time, I didn’t just feel like I belonged I felt like I was <strong>thriving</strong>.</p>

      <br>

      <p>But life reminded me that growth often walks hand in hand with <strong>grief</strong>. Just before graduation in September 2023, I <strong>lost my father</strong>. The pain was overwhelming, and for a moment, it felt like time stood still. But in the silence that followed, I remembered that each breath was still mine to take—and that meant I had another chance to carry on, in his honor.</p>

      <br>

      <p>His passing didn’t end my journey. It <strong>sharpened my purpose</strong>.</p>

      <br>

      <p><strong>Chapter 5: Building a Future from the Ground Up</strong></p>
      <p>In mid-2024, I joined <strong>Zamlift</strong> as an IT Technician, working hands-on with systems, networks, and digital infrastructure. It felt like everything I had learned was finally being put to use.</p>

      <br>

      <p>But my ambitions didn’t stop there. I launched <strong>BUFFER ZONE</strong>, a graphic design and tech company I ran as a side hustle. It was a passion project born out of <strong>creativity</strong>, <strong>curiosity</strong>, and a desire to <strong>empower small businesses</strong> with digital tools.</p>

      <br>

      <p>In early 2025, I took an even bigger leap by founding <strong>Zatralo Zambia</strong>, an online platform that allows Zambians to easily purchase bus tickets. It was a solution to a problem I had seen firsthand—a digital bridge connecting people with the <strong>freedom to travel</strong>, plan, and explore.</p>

      <br>

      <p>These businesses were more than ventures. They were my <strong>breath</strong> my <strong>second chance</strong> to shape Zambia’s future with <strong>innovation</strong>.</p>

      <br>

      <p><strong>Chapter 6: Looking Forward</strong></p>
      <p>I believe in the power of <strong>resilience</strong>, the magic of <strong>ideas</strong>, and the necessity of taking <strong>risks</strong>. My goal is not just to succeed for myself, but to leave behind systems, platforms, and tools that empower others.</p>

      <br>

      <p>From the child who moved from house to house, to the entrepreneur building digital platforms I am a testament to what happens when you <strong>don’t give up</strong>. When you see each moment not as an ending, but as an invitation to <strong>begin again</strong>.</p>

      <br>

      <p><strong>Final Words</strong></p>
      <p>Every struggle I’ve faced, every loss I’ve endured, and every success I’ve celebrated has reminded me of one thing:</p>
      <p><strong>Every breath is a second chance.</strong><br>
      A <strong>second chance</strong> to learn.<br>
      A <strong>second chance</strong> to grow.<br>
      A <strong>second chance</strong> to build the life you believe in.</p>
